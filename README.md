### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello there! I'm Zeba Afroz, and I'm excited to connect with you through my GitHub profile. As a passionate and curious researcher with a strong foundation in electronics, communication, and artificial intelligence, I've embarked on an incredible journey to explore the realms of machine learning and deep learning.

## About Me

I've always been captivated by the potential of technology, particularly in the fields of machine learning and deep learning. In a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, I recognize the profound impact these tools have on our lives, and I'm dedicated to harnessing their power for transformative research.

I completed my bachelor's degree in electronics and communication in 2020, and my thirst for knowledge led me to pursue a Master's degree in artificial intelligence at the esteemed National Institute of Technical Teacher Training and Research, Chandigarh. I was honored to secure the first rank in my batch with a CGPA of 9.12, a testament to my dedication and passion for the field.

## Current Ventures

At present, I am thriving as a Research Assistant at IIIT-H (International Institute of Information Technology - Hyderabad), where I'm delving into the fascinating realm of Generative Modeling applied to Anomaly Detection. My journey doesn't stop thereâ€”I've also shared my expertise as a Teaching Assistant at Chandigarh University, guiding students in the intricate nuances of artificial intelligence.

## Research Focus

During my Master's journey, I dove deep into the world of deep learning models, particularly focusing on image segmentation, especially in the domain of Medical Image Analysis. My research centered around enhancing the capabilities of Encoder-Decoder architectures. I relentlessly pursued ways to strike a balance between spatial and feature information generated by encoder blocks. This led me to ingeniously integrate transfer learning principles, uniting traditional autoencoders with the power of the UNet architecture. The outcome? Superior results in terms of segmented masks.

## Vision

As I continue on this exhilarating path, I'm determined to expand the horizons of my deep learning prowess, applying it to various domains of image analysis. My GitHub repositories serve as a canvas where I'll be sharing my research findings, code implementations, and explorations. I believe in the collaborative spirit of open source, so feel free to explore, contribute, and connect.

Let's embark on this journey of discovery togetherâ€”because the potential of AI and deep learning is boundless.
